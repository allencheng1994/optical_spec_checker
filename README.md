# Optical Spec Checker

Lots of people, they don't know how to define a reasonable optical spec. In this project, I want to create a checker to help people to exclude the unreasonable spec. 

## Some common sense in Optical Design
1. In most cases, the lens' total length (ttl) won't be larger than your effective focal length (efl)

2. In an optical design with optical distortion under 3%, you can use cosine law of fourth power to estimate its relative illumination. The illumination with large distortion is difficult to estimate without a completed optical design in this era. 


## Function in this project
1. Describe the relationship between efl and ttl

2. Calculate distortion

3. Estimate the relative illumination with small distortion
