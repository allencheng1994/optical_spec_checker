##Optical Spec Checker

Lots of people, they don't know how to define a reasonable optical spec. In this project, I want to create a checker to help people to exclude the unreasonable spec. 

## Some common sense in Optical Design
1. The lens' total length (ttl) won't be larger than your effective focal length (efl)

2. In an optical design with optical distortion under 3%, you can use cosine law of fourth power to estimate its relative illumination. The illumination with large distortion is difficult to estimate without a completed optical design in this era. 


## Function in this project
1. Describe the relationship between efl and ttl

2. Calculate distortion

3. Estimate the relative illumination with small distortion
